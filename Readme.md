[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This Repository includes basic JAVA SE Console and JAVA EE Web MAVEN Projects, using Hibernate/JPA and Spring (SpringCore, SpringMVC, Spring Data, Spring AOP, Spring Security, Spring REST and SpringBoot) frameworks. With Maven archetypes and cloud-located dependencies (instead of existent local jar libs), there's no need to creating a lib for any jar, nor making classpath adds/updates manually. All the local repository files needed are downloaded from the Central Maven Repository, or other alternative ones, as set at the POM xml file, regarding all dependencies and additional repositories for each project. It should only be verified if the user IDE has the Maven plugins installed (older IDE versions had not). For Spring Projects NOT using MAVEN, using Hibernate/JPA and using only SpringCore, SpringMVC and SpringAOP modules, see: https://github.com/danielpm1982/SPRING . And, for Advanced Industrial Spring Projects, using advanced integrated technologies, see: https://github.com/danielpm1982/SPRING3. All these repository projects have been upgraded to Java JDK 10 using Eclipse Photon IDE, with project facets, POMs and xml headers already updated and compatible. JAVA10+ compatible.

This repository is a collection of FINISHED projects, with no .git commit history (for each project separately) and NOT subject to change or contributions. The purpose of this and of other similar "academics" repositories in my account has been merely to store finished projects in a cloud backup, not for continuous or shared development. In case you wanna follow, issue, fork or contribute with pull requests to UNDER DEVELOPMENT projects of mine, please look for the individual repo of each respective project in my account (https://github.com/danielpm1982?tab=repositories), instead of in these "academics" repos. From now on, when under development projects are finished, I'll keep copying them to "academics" repos (as unmodifiable backup and with no .git history) but I'll start leaving the original development repos undeleted at my account as well... with all .git commit and other git objects history available in them.

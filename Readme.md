With Maven archetypes and cloud-located dependencies (instead of existent local jar libs), there's no need to creating a lib for any jar, nor make classpath adds/updates manually. All the local repository files needed are downloaded from the Central Maven Repository, or other alternative ones, as set at the POM xml file, regarding all dependencies and additional repositories for each project. It should only be verified if the user IDE has the Maven plugins installed (older IDE versions had not). Apart from this, there should be no difficulty in running the projects at a Java8+ JVM. All projects are already upgraded to Java JDK 10 using Eclipse Photon IDE, with project facets, POMs and xml headers already updated.

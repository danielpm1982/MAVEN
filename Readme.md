This Repository includes basic JAVA SE Console and JAVA EE Web MAVEN Projects, using Hibernate/JPA and Spring (SpringCore, SpringMVC, Spring Data, Spring AOP, Spring Security, Spring REST and SpringBoot) frameworks. With Maven archetypes and cloud-located dependencies (instead of existent local jar libs), there's no need to creating a lib for any jar, nor making classpath adds/updates manually. All the local repository files needed are downloaded from the Central Maven Repository, or other alternative ones, as set at the POM xml file, regarding all dependencies and additional repositories for each project. It should only be verified if the user IDE has the Maven plugins installed (older IDE versions had not). For Spring Projects NOT using MAVEN, and using only SpringCore, SpringMVC and SpringAOP modules, see: https://github.com/danielpm1982/SPRING . And, for Advanced Spring Projects and other advanced integrated technologies, see: https://github.com/danielpm1982/SPRING3. All these repository projects have been upgraded to Java JDK 10 using Eclipse Photon IDE, with project facets, POMs and xml headers already updated and compatible. JAVA10+ compatible.
